⚠️ Required materials

Computer with internet access :). For the best experience, the laptop should have [Flutter](https://www.flutter.dev/) installed on it prior to starting the codelab to save time. Windows/Linux/Mac would all be fine.

Check out: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
After you should be able to run `flutter doctor` without any errors.

A device and cable to connect to the laptop (iOS or Android ) OR an Emulator (iOS or Android). For Android you can install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or the "Command line tools only". 

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with Dart and Flutter Extensions.

To create a new flutter app, just run 

```flutter create flutter_geo_quiz```

If all runs properly...
